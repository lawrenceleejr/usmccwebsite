Charge to the National Lab Accelerator Study Group for a Muon Collider

The purpose of this study group is to:

* Identify the key accelerator challenges that must be addressed to enable the realization of a 10 TeV Muon Collider;
* Evaluate the R&D steps, including demonstrations, simulation and software tools, and facility capabilities required to address these challenges;
* Provide a technically-informed, bounded estimate of the time required to complete each major R&D category, recognizing that these estimates will inform — but not constitute — a full collider development plan; and 
* Assess the capabilities and roles of U.S. national laboratories in contributing to these critical areas.

The study should build on existing U.S. and International Muon Collider Collaboration (IMCC) R&D planning documents, critically evaluating them to identify areas of alignment, overlap, and gaps that require further attention. This includes technical gaps, infrastructure needs, and coordination challenges.

The group is not tasked with developing a full collider concept or roadmap, but rather with clarifying and prioritizing the foundational technical work needed over the next decade. The resulting estimates and findings should serve as inputs for a coordinated, evolving timeline for muon collider R&D.

Strong emphasis should be placed on coordination across U.S. national labs, as well as alignment with international efforts, to ensure that the U.S. program is both complementary and high impact in the global context.

The study group is expected to deliver a written report by July 1, 2026.
